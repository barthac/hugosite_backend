I am a postdoc at the Miller Institute and UC Berkeley working with Michael Manga on projects relating to geysers and volcanoes. I also work with Ben Holtzman and Leif Karlstrom to explore patterns within noisy, multivariate  monitoring data at volcanoes and geysers using a combination of visualization and sonification techniques.

I recently completed my PhD at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory where I studied explosive basaltic volcanism with Professor Terry Plank. Underlying the work for my masters and PhD is the broad (and deceptively simple) question of what controls on eruption style. Simply put, why do volcanoes sometimes erupt explosively and at other times produce lava flows, and what causes transitions from one style to another? These questions have required a broad approach including experiments, modeling, and field work.
