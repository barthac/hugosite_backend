Art is integral to my life, both within and outside of my research. 
I’m a keen photographer and luckily get to travel to some pretty incredible places with my work. When I’m not sketching olivine crystal habits to explain/understand some aspect of diffusion, I love to attend life drawing sessions. I also make furniture and artwork, occasionally using the laser cutter at the Columbia MakerSpace. 

If any of this is interesting to you, my artwork can be found at https://magmaarta.com

And I’d love to hear from you!
