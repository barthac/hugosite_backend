Relationship between magma decompression rate and explosive style
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
What causes two eruptions at the same volcano, with similar melt composition, crystal and volatile contents to erupt with dramatically different explosivity? 
There is a strong theoretical and growing observational basis for magma ascent rate to play a key role in modifying eruption dynamics. 

We explore whether transitions in eruption intensity correlate with differences in magma ascent rate. 
To constrain ascent rate, we exploit the incomplete diffusive re-equilibration of water through olivine crystals. You can read about this work [here](/files/barth-2019-magma-decompress.pdf)

Water diffusion through olivine
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
One of the major sources of uncertainty in our work on magma decompression rate is the diffusivity of water through olivine. 
For any given temperature, estimates of water diffusivity span four orders of magnitude. 
Part of this uncertainty comes from using synthetic versus natural olivine -- how fast water can move through the lattice depends strongly on the defect structures within the crystal, and this likely depends on crystal chemistry. 
Another cause for confusion is the strong anisotropy of the diffusion, with water diffusing ~ 1.5 orders of magnitude faster along <b><u>a</u></b> than <b><u>b</u></b> or <b><u>c</u></b>. 

We perform dehydration experiments on olivine phenocrysts from the same eruptions that we are studying for decompression rates. 
We use a furnace with oxygen fugacity controlled by CO-CO2 gas mixing. Measuring the resulting diffusion profiles along all crystallographic directions using FTIR allows us to resolve which defects are hosting the diffusion. You can read about this work [here](/files/Barth2023.pdf)

Gas migration through crystal mushes
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

Strombolian volcanic explosions are attributed to the rise and burst of discrete, conduit-filling gas slugs. 
The emitted gas often has a geochemical signature that suggests that it last equilibrated at several kilometres depth. 
The magmas associated with strombolian activity carry large proportions of phenocrysts thought to be derived from mush zones in underlying magma reservoirs. 
These mush zones have crystallinities above the threshold at which the rheology becomes non-Newtonian and is able to support a stress. 
Through analogue experiments, we explore a new mechanism to form gas slugs. 
We find that a small flux of gas supplied to the base of a particle-rich layer of liquid generates a localised intrusion of gas within the layer. 
The gas pocket initially grows through plastic-type deformation. 
However, once the pressure is sufficient to overcome the tensile strength of the particle-fluid mixture, a localised channel opens, allowing the gas to propagate upwards. As the pressure in the intrusion falls, the gas pocket collapses. 
The continued supply of gas leads to the formation of a new intrusion, and the cycle repeats. With higher gas fluxes, the pressure may be sufficient to keep the channel open, allowing for continuous gas flow through the particle-layer. 
Highly crystalline layers can therefore act as a flow valve, transforming a steady gas flux into a series of discrete surface explosions. You can read about this work [here](/files/Barth2019-Stromboli.pdf)
